# _AutoMaven_

Hi, Thanks for your interest.

# Introduction:
 This project aims to automate the entire process of Machine Learning, making it accessible to users who may find coding challenging. Auto ML streamlines the process into 6 key steps, from data uploading to model deployment and prediction.

# Steps:

### Data Uploading:

Users are presented with an interactive interface to upload their dataset in CSV format.
The interface displays comprehensive details about the uploaded data, including dataset overview, shape, size, data types, descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max), missing values, and duplicate rows.
### Data Cleaning:

Users can perform data cleaning tasks such as removing unwanted columns, filling missing values (with mean, median, or constant), removing duplicates, and outlier detection and treatment using methods like Z-score, IQR, and Percentile.
### Profiling:

Generates a report providing insights into the data, including basic visualizations, and distributions of columns.
### Data Visualization:

Offers a Tableau-like interface for exploring data through visualizations, enabling users to derive meaningful insights.
### Data Modeling:

Supervised Machine Learning: Users select problem type (regression or classification), target column, and algorithms to train on data.
Algorithms available for regression include linear regression, polynomial regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.
Algorithms available for classification include Logistic regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Ada Boost, etc.
Provides evaluation metrics such as Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, R2 Score for regression, and precision, recall, F1 score for classification.
